									<h1>A little bit about me</h1>
									<p>An Introduction</p>

								<p>
									My name is Andrew Gavin and I am currently a Student persuing an MSc in Precision Cancer Medicine at the University of Oxford. <br />
									
									I am a highly motivated individual with a strong academic background and a passion for biomedical research.<br />
									
									I also hold a Master's degree in Biomedical Engineering from Universit√© Grenoble Alpes, where I gained a comprehensive understanding of the intersection between engineering and healthcare.
									Prior to that, I completed a Bachelor's degree in Human Genetics (Biological & Biomedical Sciences) from Trinity College Dublin, where I developed a solid foundation in genetics and its 
									applications to human health.<br />
									<br />
									
									Continuously expanding my knowledge and skillset, I have completed several online courses to improve my data analytical skills and some of my completed projects are availible in the <a href="index V1.html">Projects Section</a>. <br /><br />
									
									In terms of work experience, I have held various positions that have further shaped my skills and interests. As a Research Assistant at the Grenoble Institute of Neuroscience, I 
									investigated the effect of Huntingtin ASO in TMZ-resistant Glioblastoma stem cells in vivo. I conducted experiments, including immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, DNA/RNA 
									isolation, and PCR, while also handling tumor imaging and slice preparation. <br /><br />
									
									Furthermore, I interned at St. Vincent's University Hospital, shadowing Dr. David Fennelly in the Oncology Department. I assisted the consultant in patient care, reviewed patient histories,
									and performed basic lab tests, gaining valuable insights into the clinical aspects of cancer treatment.<br /><br />
									
									Outside of my academic and professional pursuits, I am passionate about water sports and sailing. I have not only worked as a water sports instructor and entertainments manager but have also 
									served as a sailing instructor at the Irish National Sailing and Powerboat School. In their free time, I enjoy music and has been actively involved with the several orchestras and bands, 
									including participating in several competitions.<br /><br />
									
									I have achieved numerous accolades, including the Europa Excellence Scholarship from Campus France, founding the successful TCD Sport Social Programme, and receiving a music scholarship 
									at Wesley College Dublin. I have also had the privilege of performing nationally and internationally with the Cross Border Orchestra Ireland.<br />
